# Predicting-Class-of-Iris-Plant

Data Set Information:
This is perhaps the best known database to be found in the pattern recognition literature. 
The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other. 

Predicted attribute: class of iris plant. 

This is an exceedingly simple domain.
